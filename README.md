# Python Language Flash Card Playground.

This is just a simple project to experiment with using TDD 
to develop a Python app.



## Things left to do
1. Clean up UI
2. Fix lint items
3. figure out why the tests don't run on the pipe line
4. disable the buttons[correct and incorrect] until the card is flipped

## Unimplemented logic
I had planned on having the UI enter the english word before it flipped but word like Sie in german can mean "she, they, you".   I'd like to refactor the input to allow for that but don't want to take the time to do so right now.
